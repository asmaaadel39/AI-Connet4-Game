# AI-Connet4-Game

For our Artificial Intelligence class at Cairo University's Faculty of Computers and Artificial Intelligence, my colleagues and I just finished an enjoyable assignment.

We created Connect-4 game using Python . The minimax algorithm had to be put into practise in order to direct the behaviours of the intelligent agent, and alpha-beta pruning had to be used to speed up the algorithm because it can be so slow before it can play well.

Ironically, we used AI techniques to create the AI agent and speed up our coding process. We frequently utilised Chat-GPT, mostly to avoid having to start from scratch when creating code.

However, relying solely on AI tools without manual code review and testing can result in serious problems that could jeopardise the quality and security of the code. For instance, GitHub Copilot occasionally produces unethical, illogical, or even stolen code.

After finishing the game's core, we began work on its graphical user interface (GUI) using the Python packages Tkinter and Pygame.
